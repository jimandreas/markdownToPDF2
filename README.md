# Markdown to PDF converter (kotlin)

This repo is a quick project to convert a MD (markdown) file into a decent PDF (portable document format) file 
for printing.

The code was entirely written by Grok 4 Fast.  I iterated the discussion with Grok a couple of times to
include table formatting in the markdown.

I also tried the "ultimate" test file found on SO (stackoverflow).   If you run the program and look
at the file.pdf output - you can see that some features / syntax are still not implemented.  This
is left as an exercise for any hacker who might be reading this.  Pull requests are welcome.  Cheers, - Jim A

Input file = file.md

Output file = file.pdf

Run this in Intellij Idea or your favorite build system.  It uses Gradle KTS (Kotlin scripting) system.
